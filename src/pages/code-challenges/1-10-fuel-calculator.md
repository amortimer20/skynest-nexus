### Skills to Practice
- Prompting a user for input
- Converting input to the correct data type (if necessary)
- Performing arithmetic calculations
- Rounding decimal numbers
- Formatting output

### Challenge Tasks
- Create a console project named **Challenge 1-10**.
- Prompt the user to input three pieces of data: distance, vehicle gas mileage, and gas price per gallon.
- Use this information to calculate:
    - The total gallons of gas needed.
    - The total cost for the gas.
- Display the results in a clear format.

### Sample Output

```txt
