## Code Challenge 4.1 - Circle Area Calculator Function

---

### Objective

Your task is to write a program that calculates the area of a circle given its radius. This time, we’ll focus on encapsulating the code into functions/methods.

### Skills to Practice:

- Defining functions/methods.
- Passing arguments to functions.
- Returning values from functions.
- Utilizing mathematical operations.

### Challenge Tasks

- Create a console project named **Challenge 4-1**.
- Define a function/method to calculate the area of a circle.
- Example signatures:

**Python**

```py
def calculate_area(radius):
    # code
```

**C#**

```cs
double CalculateArea(double radius)
{
    // code
}
```
