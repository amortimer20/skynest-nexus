## Code Challenge 5.1 - Rectangle Class

---

### Objective

Your task is to design and implement a Rectangle class and write a program that tests the class. This challenge will focus on encapsulating object-oriented programming concepts such as constructors, methods, and fields.

### Skills to Practice

- Defining and implementing classes.
- Creating constructors.
- Defining and using methods.
- Working with object-oriented design principles.

### Challenge Tasks

1. **Create a console project named Challenge 5-1.**
2. **Draw the Class Diagram:**
    - Draw the class diagram for the Rectangle class, including fields, constructors, and methods.
3. **Class Implementation:**
    - Define a class named Rectangle with the following specifications:
        - Two double data fields named `width` and `height`.
        - A default, no-argument constructor that creates a rectangle with default values of 1.
        - A constructor that creates a rectangle with specified width and height parameters.
        - A method named `GetArea()`<sup>*</sup> that returns the area of the rectangle.
        - A method named `GetPerimeter()`<sup>*</sup> that returns the perimeter of the rectangle.
4. **Test Program:**
    - Write a test program that creates two Rectangle objects:
        - One with a width of 10 and height of 50.
        - Another with a width of 12.5 and height of 25.8.
        - Display the width, height, area, and perimeter of each rectangle in this order.

<sup>*</sup> Use the naming convention matches your programming language/preference.
