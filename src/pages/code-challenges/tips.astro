        <h2>Tips for Solving Code Challenges</h2>

        <Divider variant="8" />

        <p>
          Code challenges can be intimidating, but they're a great way to
          practice programming concepts and to improve your problem-solving
          skills. The goal isn't just to solve the challenge, but to learn and
          improve with each problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here are some strategies I recommend adopting as you work through
          these challenges:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="text-skynest-theme">Read the problem thoroughly</span>: Skim
            reading can lead to missed details. Take time to understand the
            problem statement fully, including any constraints and examples
            provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="text-skynest-theme">Break it down</span>: Tackling a big
            problem can feel overwhelming. Divide it into smaller parts and
            solve each part individually before piecing them back together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="text-skynest-theme">Plan your approach</span>: Before you
            start typing, think about the structure of your solution. Pseudocode
            can help outline your logic and spot potential issues before coding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="text-skynest-theme">Test early, test often</span>:
            Discovering a bug in 10 lines of code is way easier than finding it
            in 50 lines. Each time you complete a section of your program, test
            it with various inputs to make sure it works as you expect. By doing
            so, youâ€™ll catch problems before they grow and become more complex.
            Keep testing and save yourself the headache later.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="text-skynest-theme">Keep it clean</span>: Clean, readable
            code is easier to debug and understand. Use meaningful variable
            names, consistent indentation, and add comments to explain complex
            logic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="text-skynest-theme">Learn from others</span>: Reviewing
            others' solutions exposes you to different techniques and
            optimizations, sparking new ideas and enhancing your skills.
            However, avoid relying too heavily on others for every little issue
            in your code. While it's great to seek help, overdoing it can stunt
            your growth and learning process. Strive for balance, and use peer
            insights to augment, not replace your own problem-solving efforts.
