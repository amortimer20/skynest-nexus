## Code Challenge 2.7 - Coin Flip Simulator

---

### Objective

Your task is to create a program that simulates flipping a coin multiple times based on user input. The program will keep track of how many times heads and tails occur and display the counts and percentages at the end.

### Skills to Practice

- Using loops to repeat actions based on user input.
- Generating random numbers to simulate coin flips.
- Counting occurrences and calculating percentages.
- Displaying results in a clear and concise format.

### Challenge Tasks

- Create a console project named **Challenge 2-7**.
- Ask the user to enter the number of times they want to flip the coin.
- Use a loop to "flip" the coin the specified number of times.
- Keep track of the number of heads and tails.
- Calculate the percentage of heads and tails.
- Display the total number of heads and tails and their respective percentages.

#### Sample Output

```txt
Enter the number of times to flip the coin: 10 [Enter]
Flip 1: Heads
Flip 2: Tails
Flip 3: Heads
Flip 4: Heads
Flip 5: Tails
Flip 6: Heads
Flip 7: Tails
Flip 8: Tails
Flip 9: Heads
Flip 10: Heads

Results:
Heads: 6 (60%)
Tails: 4 (40%)
```
