## Code Challenge 5.2 - Student Class

---

### Objective
Your task is to design and implement a Student class and write a program that tests the class. This challenge will focus on encapsulating object-oriented programming concepts such as constructors, methods, and fields.

### Skills to Practice
- Defining and implementing classes.
- Creating constructors.
- Defining and using methods.
- Working with object-oriented design principles.

### Challenge Tasks

1. **Create a console project named Challenge 5-2.**
2. **Draw the Class Diagram:**
   - Draw the class diagram for the Student class, including fields, constructors, and methods.
3. **Class Implementation:**
    - Define a class named `Student` with the following specifications:
        - Two string data fields named `name` and `id`.
        - A constructor that initializes the fields with specified parameters.
        - A method named `GetDetails()`<sup>*</sup> that returns the student's name and id.
4. **Test Program:**
    - Write a test program that creates two Student objects:
        - One with name "Alice" and id "A123".
        - Another with name "Bob" and id "B456".
    - Display the name and id of each student in this order.

<sup>*</sup> Use the naming convention that matches your programming language/preference.
