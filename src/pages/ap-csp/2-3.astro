const PreambleRules = `Rules for this review:
- Do NOT rewrite, refactor, or generate code.
- Do NOT suggest specific lines of code to add/change.
- Only identify whether Create PT requirements are met and explain why or why not.
- If something is missing, describe the conceptual gap, not how to implement it.

const Prompt1 = `I am completing the AP CSP Create Performance Task.

Below is my program code.

Your job is to act as a rubric reviewer, not a programmer.

${PreambleRules}

Check the following:
1. Is there real user input?
2. Is there a list that manages program state meaningfully?
3. Is there a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter?
4. Does that procedure contain sequencing, selection, and iteration?
5. Is output clearly produced based on input and processing?

Respond in a checklist format with brief explanations.

[PASTE MY CODE BELOW]
`;

const Prompt2 = `Review ONLY the student-developed procedure in the code below.

${PreambleRules}

Answer these questions:
1. Does the procedure have at least one parameter?
2. Is the procedure actually called somewhere in the program?
3. Does the procedure execute multiple steps top-to-bottom? (sequencing)
4. Does it contain a conditional decision? (selection)
5. Does it contain a loop? (iteration)
6. Are all of these inside the same procedure?

Explain your reasoning in plain English.

[PASTE MY PROCEDURE + THE CALL SITE BELOW]
`;

const Prompt3 = `Look at the procedure below.

${PreambleRules}

Question:
Does this procedure execute multiple steps in a clear top-to-bottom order before producing a result?

Explain your answer WITHOUT using AP terminology.

[PASTE MY PROCEDURE BELOW]
`;

const Prompt4 = `Review how the list is used in the program below.

${PreambleRules}

Answer:
1. What information does the list store?
2. How is the list used more than once?
3. Would the program be harder to write or explain without this list?

If the list does NOT manage complexity, explain why in conceptual terms only.

[PASTE MY CODE BELOW]
`;

const Prompt5 = `Assume you are a grader watching a Create PT video.

Based on the program below, answer:
1. What input should be shown in the video?
2. What processing should be visible?
3. What output must be clearly shown?

${PreambleRules}

Only describe what must be demonstrated in the video.

[PASTE MY CODE BELOW]
`;

const Prompt6 = `Below is my Create PT written response draft.

${PreambleRules}

Check:
1. Do I clearly identify my list?
2. Do I explain what my procedure does?
3. Do I explain how the algorithm works?
4. Do I explain how input affects output?

Respond with:
- Missing
- Weak
- Clear

Include a brief explanation for each.
