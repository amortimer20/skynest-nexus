const SampleOutput = `
Your car crashes into a tree during a thunderstorm in the woods.
Darkness surrounds you as thunder crashes and rain pours.
You spot a cave nearby, dimly lit by flashes of lightning, and run towards it for shelter.
Inside, you see two shadowy paths diverging deeper into the unknown...

Which path do you take? (left or right) -> left

As you move forward, you see something glimmering on the ground - a Hostess Twinkie.
Do you eat the Twinkie for sustenance, or will you save it for later?
(take or eat) -> take
You slip the Twinkie into your pocket, unsure what awaits in the darkness...

You cautiously take the left path.
A few steps in, you freeze as the piercing eyes of a pack of wolves emerge from the shadows.
The pack leader, larger and fiercer than the others, steps forward, growling softly...

Do you offer the pack leader your hand in peace? (yes or no) -> yes
As you reach out, the wolves smell the Twinkie...
In a frenzy of hunger, they turn on you, and you're surrounded with no escape!

-- Ending --
Game Over!

            <p>
              It's crucial to keep your code nicely formatted. Good formatting
              makes code easier to read, understand, and debug.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment">
              <b>1. Indentation: </b>Always indent one tab for every code block.
              If you have a nested block, the code in the nested block should be
              indented again. This visually shows the level of nesting.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment">

              <b>3. Spacing Sections: </b>Space your code based on logical
              sections. Avoid bunching up your entire program; this makes it
              much easier to read and isolate issues when debugging.
